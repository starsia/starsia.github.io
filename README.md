# starsia.github.io

Update 5 Jun 2023: 
Managed to get my first working website online with a proper domain name and using Github Pages for hosting! 
You can view it at zhongqingsia.com
For now I'll explore more layout formats and implement more features as I go. 

Hello! You're looking at my first attempt in creating my own personal website. Please be kind and support me in my learning journey :) It'll only get better. 

I will be working based on an initial template as I figure my way around HTML/CSS/JS.

Thanks for reading!
